# historicalrailwaydata

Datafiles originating from my database about the Belgian historical railway data (www.historicraildata.eu). This repository contains:
- a KML file with all tracks of current and demolished passenger railway lines (raildata_BE.kml)
- a JSON file with names, coordinates and Wikidata ID of current and former stations (stations_en.json)
- a JSON file with all current and former railway lines and their respective stations (stations_lines.json). The identifier of the stations correspond with stations_en.json.
