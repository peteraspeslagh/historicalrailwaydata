# historicalrailwaydata

Datafiles originating from my database about the Belgian historical railway data. This repository contains:
- a KML file with all tracks of current and demolished passenger railway lines (raildata_BE.kml)
- a JSON file with names, coordinates and Wikidata ID of current and former stations (stations_en.json)
- a JSON file with lines and stations (stations_lines.json). The identifier of the stations correspond with the stations_en.json
